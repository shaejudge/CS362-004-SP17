Random Test Quiz 2

I created the random character and the random string generator functions.
I realized that there were a certain amount of ASCII characters that would have to correspond
to the proper characters that I would be randomly generating. When the proper combination of
random character and random string was achieved, I was able to see the error message in 
my console window.
